Come one, come all to the first ever /r/ultralight swap meet! 

This will be a two week swap meet where you can sell/trade gear with your fellow redditors. Please keep items at least related to /r/ultralight and backpacking/hiking/camping. 

At the end of the two week (September 1), the thread will be locked. This is to encourage all of us to actually look through our closets instead of procrastinating. It is to also help us keep responses and transaction timely.

**Disclaimer: Sell/trade at your own risk. Check your buyer/seller to make sure they are trustworthy.**

##Rules:
1. Account must be at least one month old. And have 100 comment karma. 
2. A verification post with items and user name must be provided.
3. Packages must be sent out within one week. 
4. You must get a tracking number to prove item has been shipped.
5. Paypal is recommended for buyer/seller protection (arguably anyways).
6. Do not post identifying information, do that through PMs.
7. Root posts are for listings only. ~~Cross~~ things out as they are sold. New root posts may be made when 50% of your inventory has changed, use your discretion.
