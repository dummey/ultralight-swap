Come one, come all to the first ever /r/ultralight swap meet! 

This will be a two week swap meet where you can sell/buy/trade gear with your fellow redditors. Please keep items at least related to /r/ultralight and backpacking/hiking/camping. 

At the end of the two week (September 1), the thread will be locked. This is to encourage all of us to actually look through our closets instead of procrastinating. It is to help us keep responses and transaction timely. And to save all of us all time. 

**Disclaimer: Donâ€™t be a jerk.**

##Rules:
Account must be at least one month old. And have 100 comment karma. 
A verification post with items and user name must be provided.
Packages must be sent out within one week. 
You must get a tracking number to prove item has been shipped.
Paypal is recommended for buyer/seller protection (arguably anyways).
Do not post identifying information, do that through PMs.
Make your root post with cross outs for sold items. New root posts can be made when 50% of your inventory has changed (by adding new things or by selling old things), use your discretion.
